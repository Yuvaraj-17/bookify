            <tr><td><p id="descriptionbook">Description : <p style="color: #09a960;"> Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert T. Kiyosaki is a powerful personal finance book that compares the money mindsets of two fathers — the author’s real dad, who was well-educated but financially struggling, and his friend’s dad, a successful businessman who never finished college. Through their contrasting lessons, Kiyosaki learns that wealth isn’t about how much you earn but how you think about money and how you make it work for you. The book explains that most people spend their lives working for money, while the rich make money work for them by building assets like businesses, investments, and real estate. Kiyosaki stresses the importance of financial education — something schools rarely teach — and encourages readers to learn how money, investing, and entrepreneurship actually work. He also highlights that buying liabilities such as cars or luxury items traps people in the “rat race,” whereas buying assets leads to financial freedom. The book motivates readers to overcome fear, take risks wisely, and develop financial intelligence instead of relying on a secure job. With its simple stories and easy concepts, Rich Dad Poor Dad has become one of the best-selling financial books in the world, inspiring millions to change how they view wealth, work, and success.</p></p></td></tr>
