# bookify
This project is a simple Book Reminder Web App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets users add books as reading reminders using a popup form and delete them after reading. The app uses alerts for empty fields, real-time updates, and smooth popups, demonstrating basic DOM manipulation and event handling.
